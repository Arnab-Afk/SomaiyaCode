However, the resume needs some restructuring and adjustments to better align with the specific job description provided. \n\n**Section-Specific Recommendations:**\n\n**1.  Contact Information:**\n\n* **Remove Social Media Links:** While impressive, they are not relevant for this specific job description. Keep it professional by focusing on email and phone.\n* **Format:** Use a consistent format for the contact information. Separate elements with commas or spaces for better readability.\n\n**2.  Education:**\n\n* **Highlight Relevant Courses:**  Emphasize courses directly related to the job description.  For example, mention any database courses (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or software development courses.\n* **Quantify Achievements:**  Mention GPA (already included) but consider adding specific academic achievements, like awards or honors received.\n* **Project/Experience:**  Include relevant projects done during your studies. This is a great way to showcase practical skills.\n\n**3.  Experience:**\n\n* **Focus on Relevant Experience:**  The job description emphasizes a focus on HR. While your technical skills are impressive, highlight experiences where you demonstrated soft skills like communication, teamwork, or problem-solving relevant to HR.\n* **Quantify Impact:**  Use numbers to showcase your achievements. For example, instead of saying "Spearheaded and hosted impactful events," quantify the success by mentioning the number of attendees or participants you reached.\n* **Tailor Language:** Use language from the job description to highlight keywords like "employee-oriented," "high performance," or "continuous improvement." \n\n**4.

It's perfectly fine to include LinkedIn and a portfolio website on a resume, especially if they are relevant to the job you are applying for.\n\nHere's why those links can be beneficial:\n\n* **LinkedIn:** Provides a more detailed overview of your professional experience, skills, and connections.
